[Intro]
It feels good
It feels good

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waking up this time
Like I've never been tired
Of making up my mind

[Chorus]
It feels good
It feels good, oh, feels good, oh
It feels good
It feels good, oh, feels good, oh

[Verse 1]
I lit my last one then I fell asleep in slime
Work at my habits but the feel is so sublime
Another drag in and my mind goes on a climb
That's where you'll catch me cause it happens all the time
Always on the move, always live proof
I'm just trying to prove what you disapproved
All this residue, don't know what to do with
Facing down the truth, tell me where were you
These are my hands that build me up
But where were you
Yeah, tell me where were you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waking up this time
Like I've never been tired
Of making up my mind

[Chorus]
It feels good
It feels good, oh, feels good, oh
It feels good
It feels good, oh, feels good, oh

[Verse 2]
I lit my last one then I fell asleep in slime
Work at my habits but the feel is so sublime
Ready to deploy, ready to exploit
Can't express my joy, my life I didn't destroy
I will not recoil, dope inside the foil
Problems I can't avoid, I can not employ
How's it look now
Standing with your eyes to the fire
I won't look down
Standing with my eyes to the light

[Bridge]
Feels good oh, feels good oh
Feels good oh, feels good
(Of making up my mind)
Feels good oh
[Chorus]
It feels good
It feels good oh, feels good oh
It feels good
It feels good oh, feels good oh

[Outro]
I lit my last one then I fell asleep in slime
Work at my habits but the feel is so sublime
Another drag in and my mind goes on a climb
That's where you'll catch me cause it happens all the time
